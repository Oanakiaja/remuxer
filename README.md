# remuxer
webcodecs for mp4 -> webm

## Motivation
It started because of a twitter thread https://twitter.com/JNYBGR/status/1822193181074612243

I have also been learning about Web Media Tech recently. I want to use WebCodecs to create a remuxer to convert mp4 to webm.

## What is a remuxer?

Local & Private & Quick & Free

lower the cost.
